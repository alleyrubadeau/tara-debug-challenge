    <p id="p2p4">I <em>am</em> excited for gSchool. But there's alot of other emotions in that mix too. And lets be honest, fear is one of them.</p>

    <p id="p2p5">The path from A to B is never simple. And if it was, it wouldn't be half the adventure.</p>

    <p id="p2p6">I'm new enough in this world of the interwebs that I don't know where I'll end up.  I'd like to think I could go back to the world of healthcare. The medical apps that are being developed these days are amazing!</p>

      <ul id="p2p7">
          <li>phone app that monitors your bloodsugar via a sub-q implant</li>
          <li>phone app that that can be used as an EKG</li>
          <li>the first medical tricoder</li>
          <li>and the list goes on...</li>
